1. Generate Fibonacci numbers,

Solution: Start with a pair of ones, combine them,
then combine the result with the second number, then continue with this method untill you
have a satisfying chain
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on

Demo of code:

Number1 = 1
Number2 = 1

Number3 = Number1 + Number2
Number1 = Number2
Number2 = Number3

2. Finding your quickest way through a supermarket,

Solution: categorize the items on your list, For example Milk = Dairy,
Then look for the first aisle that triggers a category for an item on your list
if you are left with any leftover items go through again by generalising your item even more,
Milk = cold food,
as a last ditch option go through every aisle one by one untill you find what you need
but this should only be an emergency option.
